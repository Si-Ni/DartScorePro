## Singleplayer
First of all, you can [configure your game](#game-configuration).  
You can then play a game of darts on your own with the selected settings.

## Multiplayer

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/c59900a0-9c6d-4f41-866c-1fac5a7c35b1)

You can choose between:
- [Local Multiplayer](#local-multiplayer)
- [Online Multiplayer](#online-multiplayer)

### Local multiplayer:
Add up to 4 players:

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/0e482358-bc61-4197-a2ef-de5052329cef)

Afterwards [configure your game](#game-configuration) and enjoy playing with your friends.

### Online multiplayer: 
You have the option of creating a new lobby:

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/6bd3dbe8-7441-435a-b797-81e5ee19088f)

or joining an existing one. Use the following menu:

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/3832c3a6-fc9a-4241-8588-f527afaf8f32)

or join directly via the lobby URL:

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/2a1eff14-450e-403c-89ec-8d28c6d8b149)

Now all the lobby manager has to do is [configure](#game-configuration) and start the game and you're ready to go.  

If you have accidentally left the game, you can of course rejoin, but no new players will be able to join.   
Inactive players will be skipped (marc has left the game).

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/bfdeccc3-3823-4de8-b5cc-fd90071ac55a)

## Tournament
Add 2, 4, 6 or 16 players and [configure your game](#game-configuration):

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/86fbd0f7-d759-4807-be7f-2943bd48e763)

Then 2 players are randomly selected for a game. The winner advances to the next round and the loser is eliminated from the tournament.  
This process is repeated until there are only 2 players left and the winner of the tournament is determined in this match.

## Checkout calculator
You can enter a remaining score in the checkout calculator and the most common checkout will be displayed:

![image](https://github.com/Si-Ni/DartScorePro/assets/62617399/609657fb-fd92-4b48-b33e-fafc4c43fa25)

You can also display all possible checkouts for this score:

The red left border marks the current player. The red dot next to the player's name indicates the player who started the leg.  
If your remaining score is checkable, the blue checkout option shows you the most common checkout and the yellow one shows your most used checkout for this score.  
You can also see your last 3 throws, your average score for this game and the sets and legs you have already won.

## Social media sharing
After winning a game, you can share this success on Whatsapp or Twitter.
